# 3sum
Problem from Leetcode: Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements
 a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the
 array which gives the sum of zero.

This turned out to be a very interesting and challenging exercise
 in that it was easy to find brute-force solutions that produced
 the desired results but took too long to satisfy Leetcode's
 execution time contraints.

It took four attempts before I was able to jump over the performance
 hurdle. This was a pretty good learning experience that I am archiving
 in a repo.
